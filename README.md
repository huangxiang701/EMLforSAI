# EMLforSAI
Explainable Machine Learning for Predicting Student Acceptance of the LLM-Powered Virtual Counseling System S·AI.
## Description
We proposed a novel workflow for predicting the target outcome from input predictors using machine learning classification, with feature contributions derived from model interpretation. The framework integrates three core components: the dataset, the machine learning models, and feature contribution analysis.
